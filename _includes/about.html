        <h2>WHAT IS NEIC?</h2>
        <p>
          The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) facilitates
          development and operation of high-quality e-Infrastructure solutions in areas
          of joint Nordic interest. NeIC is a distributed organisation consisting of
          technical experts from academic high-performance computing centres across the
          Nordic countries.

        <h2>OUR HISTORY</h2>
        <div class="read-more-block readless">
          <p>
            In 2002 the Joint Committee of the Nordic Natural Science Research
            Councils (NOS-N) supported a pilot project with the aim of establishing an
            inter-Nordic data grid test facility (NDGF). The purpose of the NDGF was to
            distribute computing infrastructure. After a two-year pilot period, the NDGF
            was given the mandate to propose a Nordic grid infrastructure and an
            organisation to manage and develop the grid for scientific computing in the
            Nordic countries. The NDGF was hosted by NORDUnet A/S.
          </p>
          <p>
            The NDGF pilot has since matured into the successful deployment of the
            first and only distributed Tier-1 service within the WLCG collaboration, and
            has served as a role model for regional collaboration.

      <h2>ORGANISATION</h2>
      <p>
        NeIC is a joint initiative between the Nordic countries, hosted by
        NordForsk since 1. January 2012. NordForsk appoints the NeIC Board based on
        nominations by the national e-infrastructure provider organisations. These
        strategic partner organisation are CSC (Finland), SNIC (Sweden), UNINETT Sigma2
        (Norway), DeIC (Denmark) and RH Net (Iceland). The NeIC Board consists of one
        representative from each of these.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NordForsk Board has delegated to the NeIC Board the authority to make strategic
        decisions regarding computing and data-storage infrastructure and react on upcoming
        opportunities. This includes allocating budget, implementing the organisation structure
        as well as prioritising and coordinating Nordic collaboration projects. The NeIC Board
        develops and maintains a strategy for NeIC. The NeIC Board recommends the NeIC Director
        to be appointed by NordForsk.
      </p>
      <p>
        NeIC is managed by an Executive Team chaired by the NeIC Director.
        Most of NeICâ€™s activities are organized in projects. The Executive Team
        coordinates the activities and participate in project steering groups as
        project owners.
      </p>
      <p>
        In collaboration with national eInfrastructure providers and
        user-community representatives, NeIC engages IT experts to participate in
        projects and operational activities. Projects are developed in accordance with
        the directions set out in the Nordic eScience Action Plan 2.0 (2015).
