NeIC is arranging a [dugnad](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dugnad) for proposals for projects to take on within the Bio- and Medical Sciences (BMS) area. Projects should have a 6-36 month duration, with involvement from 2 or preferably more Nordic countries, and should be for concrete, measurable e-infrastructure improvements in Nordic BMS. This can for example involve development of innovative storage or computation services tailored to BMS needs, or improving security or features in BMS software to enable safer use or higher quality research.

More information and registration may be found on [NeIC wiki](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/BMS_project_proposal_workshop)
