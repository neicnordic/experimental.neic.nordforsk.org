The participants unanimously agreed that such small dedicated meetings are very useful in getting the right people to talk to each other.

Also the remote participants from Norway, Iceland and the UK could contribute to the meeting in a meaningful way.

All slides and links are online on the [wiki page](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Nordic_accounting_workshop_2014). The complete minutes will be made available during next week.

The next come-together will be during the dedicated workshop session on accounting at the NeIC2015 conference near Helsinki in May 2015.

Special thanks go to the local staff at Uppsala University for their great support.
