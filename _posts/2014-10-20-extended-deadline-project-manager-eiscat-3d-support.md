Extended deadline: Project manager/e-infrastructure specialist for EISCAT_3D support
=====================================================================================

**EISCAT_3D is an environmental research infrastructure on the European ESFRI roadmap, and NeIC is seeking a project manager/e-infrastructure specialist who can support the EISCAT_3D project in dealing with e-infrastructure challenges.**

It is proposed as an international research infrastructure using the incoherent scatter technique to study the upper atmosphere above the Arctic in order to investigate how the Earth's atmosphere is coupled to space.

EISCAT_3D is a multi-static phased array radar system that will be installed at remote locations in the most Northern parts of the Scandinavian peninsula. The system will be operated by and be an integral part of the EISCAT Scientific Association.

The e-infrastructure challenges for EISCAT_3D include finding cost-efficient state of the art solutions for on-site computing and establishing network connections between the different sites and with the data archive. The goal of the NeIC "Supporting EISCAT_3D" project is to support the preparation of the implementation of EISCAT_3D for the aspects concerning e-infrastructure. Particular goals also include to develop solutions for locating the data archive within existing national e-infrastructures and to support EISCAT in planning the recruitment of e-science experts.

NeIC is now seeking a project manager/e-infrastructure specialist who can support the EISCAT_3D project in dealing with those e-infrastructure challenges. The ideal candidate is a self-motivated technical expert with good communication, collaboration and management skills who likes to travel. Expertise in areas like process architecture, real-time distributed computing architecture, synchronization, distributed computing and control would be a definite advantage. He/She will report to the new NeIC ENV area coordinator and is expected to have 50% of his/her time committed to lead the "Supporting EISCAT_3D" project.

The position has a term of three years. Applications including CV should be submitted to <neic@nordforsk.org> within the extended deadline ***November 20th***. Questions about the position may be directed to [Gudmund Høst](mailto:gudmund.host@nordforsk.org), phone +47 95816846.
