13 days to go – registration open until Sunday 26 April
=======================================================

**NeIC2015 conference – Nordic Collaboration for Global Excellence is coming up soon! Nearly 200 participants have registered, and registration is open until Sunday 26 April.**

<a href="{% include baseurl %}/assets/images/news/nancy-image.jpg"> <img class="smallpic" src="{% include baseurl %}/assets/images/news/nancy-image_mini.jpg"> </a>

The programme consists of two days of workshops (5-6 May) and two days of sessions (7-8 May). One of the keynote speakers we are very pleased to announce and looking forward to hearing is Associate Director of San Diego Supercomputer Center Nancy Wilkins-Diehr, who will give a presentation entitled “The Science Gateways Program from its inception to the present day.” Ms. Wilkins-Diehr has led the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Science Gateways programme since 2005.

“Science gateways are having a tremendous influence on access to high performance computing. Basically, gateways are community-designed web interfaces, so we’ve greatly expanded accessibility of the HPC machines. Today about 40% of the users of NSF HPC machines come in through gateways. In addition, the NSF is beginning exciting new investments in this area through a science gateway institute via its [software institutes program](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2015/nsf15553/nsf15553.htm),” states Ms. Wilkins-Diehr.
