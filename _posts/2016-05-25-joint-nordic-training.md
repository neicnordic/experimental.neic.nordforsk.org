Joint Nordic training: Improve your e-Skills
============================================

**To make the most of our e-infrastructure resources in the Nordic countries, NeIC has launched a coordinated Nordic calendar indicating when and where you can find events to improve your skills. An easy and simple tool to use.**

A new Nordic training calendar
------------------------------

Today, NeIC is releasing a coordinated Nordic calendar to collect and disseminate information on upcoming training events that are being arranged by the NeIC or its partners, or are of interest to NeIC and NeIC stakeholders.

<a href="{% include baseurl %}/assets/images/news/Social_Network_Diagram_from_Wikipedia.png"> <img class="smallpic" src="{% include baseurl %}/assets/images/news/Social_Network_Diagram_from_Wikipedia_mini.png"> </a> This calendar is called NeIC training. You can view upcoming training events here: <https://neic.no/training/>

And more on accessing the calendar here: <https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Training>

The calendar currently contains training activities from four countries.

At present, training coordinators use email lists to spread information on upcoming training events to interested parties. The calendar also enables them to include information on upcoming training activities in neighbouring countries that may be of interest to their stakeholders.

Pooling competencies
--------------------

NeIC Training calendar is part of realising the [new NeIC strategy](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/NeIC_Strategy_2016-2020). It is divided into four focus areas, one of which is "[Pool Competencies](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Pool_Competencies)".

The board organisations have each appointed one person to a working group which will map out competencies (and needs for competencies) among the Nordic e-infrastructures, research infrastructures, users and other closely associated stakeholders.

The board organisations view the training aspect as being so important that most of them have appointed their coordinator of training activities to the Pool Competencies working group. The group has decided to use "training" as the first topic for competency mapping.

The [members of the working group](https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Pool_Competencies#Working_group) are:

-   Rob Pennington, NeIC (chair)
-   Michaela Barth, NeIC (coordination)
-   DK: Lene Krøl Andersen, DeIC
-   FI: Jussi Enkovaara, CSC
-   NO: Vigdis Guldseth, UNINETT
-   SE: Joachim Hein, SNIC
-   IS: Jón Ingi Einarsson, RHnet and Saethor L. Jonsson, RHI
-   Joel Hedlund, NeIC (observer)
