NeIC is seeking Resource Sharing Project Manager
================================================

**NeIC is looking for a Project Manager to implement a main component of the NeIC strategy.

In the context of NeIC’s strategy implementation plan, the resources to share can be hardware (CPU cycles, storage), software, services, or human resources. A framework for sharing hardware resources is necessary for pursuing several collaboration opportunities, including HPC, data storage and cloud initiatives. Important elements include federated authentication, authorization and accounting, as well as harmonizing procedures in compliance with national rules and regulations. Another opportunity is the sharing of application expertise for advanced user support. The project will be defined and carried out with the involvement of national providers through an open planning effort. The planning will explore and consider the possibilities, processes and steps necessary to carry out the project in a manner that is harmonized with and supportive of the national providers and programs while also supporting Nordic programs. Previous investigations into billing and accounting may also provide a useful background for the work.

The Project Manager reports to the Executive Team and to the Project Steering Group. The functions and responsibilities of the Project Manager include:

-   Developing and maintaining a detailed project plan.
-   Participating in the selection of project staff.
-   Leading work in the distributed team toward deliveries and project completion.
-   Providing regular progress reports for the project.
-   Maintaining an active requirements dialogue with stakeholders or reference groups.
-   Producing the final report upon project completion.

The ideal candidate has excellent communication and collaboration skills, as well as expertise from development, deployment or operation of e-infrastructure services. Candidates are expected to have experience in managing projects, relevant higher education and broad knowledge of technologies used in e-infrastructures for research. Candidates must have a good command of English (both written and spoken).

As member of the dynamic virtual NeIC team you will have a variety of challenging tasks and that involves extensive contact with research groups and specialist communities in the Nordic countries and internationally. It is expected that the candidate has, or is interested in, employment at a national e-infrastructure organization in the Nordic countries or one of its collaborating institutions. For candidates applying from outside the Nordic countries NeIC will offer assistance in establishing a practical employment relation. Considerable travelling may be required. The Project Manager is expected to commit 50-100% of his/her time to NeIC over a three-year period, any remaining time being committed to his/her home institution.

Questions may be directed to incoming NeIC Executive Manager Tomasz Malkiewicz, tomasz.malkiewicz@csc.fi tel. +358 50 381 2081 or NeIC Director Gudmund Høst, tel. +47 95816846. Applications including CV should be submitted to gudmund.host@nordforsk.org within January 31st, 2017.
