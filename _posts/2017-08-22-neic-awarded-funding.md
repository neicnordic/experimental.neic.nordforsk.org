# NeIC awarded funding from the Research Council of Norway

NeIC, together with Sigma2, is one of 19 projects (out of 92 applicants) who have been invited to contract negotiations with the Research Council of Norway as part of a call under the National Financing Initiative for Research Infrastructure (INFRASTRUKTUR). Through this call a total of 1 billion NOK is awarded to projects working on advancing research infrastructures. NeIC has been awarded support for its work on research e-infrastructure for the timeframe 2018- 2022.
 
In its announcement, RCN writes that e-infrastructure is important for many academic disciplines, and particularly research that generate large amounts of data and where complex calculations are needed.
 
«I am delighted that the Research Council of Norway has chosen to prioritise long term support for Nordic collaboration on digital infrastructures for research», says Gudmund Høst, Director of NeIC. «This will put us in an excellent position to continue supporting development of common Nordic services beyond what is possible using only national capabilities.»
