## Application Programming Interface

Our website in general tries to make information on NeIC available in a format
that is comfortable for humans to read.

Our API makes the same information available in a format that is comfortable for
computers to read.

Having an API makes it easier for developers to make services on top of our
information, to provide up-to-date views and reports on NeIC activities. For
example, NeIC uses this API internally in our activities to track fluctuations
in staffing over time, to ensure it all adds up in the end.
